A novice cheat sheet with common keyboard shortcuts and action for Blender.

I’m starting to learn Blender. In my first steps, I’ve made handwritten annotations and I convert it in a “clean” graphic cheat sheet.

I know the Giudansky ones (https://markoze.com/tutorial/blender/blender-keyboard-shortcuts-or-cheatsheet) and they are very good, but extended for a novice use.
So I decide to make for myself and the keyboard shortcuts, actions and things I commonly use (at least for now). Also, more print-friendly.

So, here is. Any comments/errors are welcome.

*__(Months later)__* I've been still practicing Blender. So I added a "second" page with more tips and annotations for my personal use. With the same spirit, I share it.

As now there are two pages, here is also a PDF version:

I've been collecting some free resources: assets, textures, add-ons, software... for 3D. I keep it updated, I leave the document here:
