A novice cheat sheet with common keyboard shortcuts and action for Blender 3

I’m starting to learn Blender. In my first steps, I’ve made handwritten annotations and I convert it in a “clean” graphic cheat sheet.

I know the Giudansky ones (https://markoze.com/tutorial/blender/blender-keyboard-shortcuts-or-cheatsheet) and they are very extended for a novice use, so I decide to make for myself and the keyboard shortcuts, actions and things I commonly use (at least for now).

So, here is. Any comments/errors are welcome.
